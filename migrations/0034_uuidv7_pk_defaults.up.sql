--
-- Database : chora_tenancy
-- Context  : Owner ruling 2026-09-01. The UUIDv7 invariant in CLAUDE.md and
--            .claude/rules/ddd-enforcement.md held at the APPLICATION layer
--            only: a live census on 2026-09-01 counted 3,882 uuid.NewV7() call
--            sites in Go against 16 primary-key columns in this database still
--            defaulting to gen_random_uuid(), which is a v4. A row inserted
--            without an explicit id, by a seed, a backfill or hand SQL, got a
--            v4 and nothing said so. PostgreSQL 18 ships a native uuidv7(), and
--            this instance is 18.4, so the invariant can now hold at both
--            layers instead of one.
--
-- SAFETY
-- ------
-- Metadata-only. Changing a column DEFAULT rewrites no rows and touches no
-- index; existing v4 keys keep their values and stay valid. Only rows inserted
-- AFTER this migration get a v7. The two id shapes coexist, which is expected:
-- uuid is uuid, and nothing in the schema or the Go code parses a version out
-- of a key.
--
-- ⚠ IDEMPOTENT BY CONSTRUCTION, and it has to be. This selects the columns to
-- change at run time rather than naming them, so a re-run finds nothing left at
-- gen_random_uuid() and is a no-op. That matters because the apply job replays
-- from a GCS snapshot rather than from git, so a file can legitimately run
-- twice, and because any table added between authoring and applying is picked
-- up rather than missed.
--
-- ⚠ Column count is NOT asserted. It was measured live at authoring time and is
-- recorded above for provenance only. Asserting it would make this migration
-- fail on any table added or dropped in the interim, which is a worse failure
-- than a drifting comment.
